In this Movies 2023 Project, which dateset I borrowed from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadrizwansajjad/top-200-movies-of-2023), I used DAX functions in PowerBI to retrieve the needed metrics for further visualization. 
On the dashboard I visualized Total Gross Revenue, Distributors by Revenue, Average Theaters per Movie, Total Gross Revenue by Month and Top 10 Movies by Revenue. 
I also added a slicer pannel which user can pop up and hide for filtering values.
